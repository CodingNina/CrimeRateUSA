<h1 align="center">CrimeRateUSA Shiny Application </h1>

<p> The goal of this project is to show different rates of four main crimes: Murder, Assault, UrbanPop and Rape, accross the US State, in an choropleth map.
The Shiny App has two widgets: one for selecting which crime to select and a slider to choose the range you're interested into.
